    <h1>Kata: Correct the mistakes of the character recognition software</h1>
    <p>
      Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts.
      <br />
      Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.<br />
      <br />
      When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter),
      <br />
      are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.<br />
      <br />
      Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have
      <br />
      to handle the following mistakes:<br />
      <br />
      S is misinterpreted as 5<br />
      O is misinterpreted as 0<br />
      I is misinterpreted as 1<br />
      <br />
      The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.<br />
